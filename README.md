## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

<br>

This project is about predicting popularity of a set of blog articles. The objective is maximizing the ROC AUC, i.e. the Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. 

A rate of **94 % AUC** has been reached using **Natural Language Processing** and an **ensemble Machine Learning solution** combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest. Combination has been tested with ROC curves and AUCs on bootstrapped resamples.
