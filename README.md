## II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

<br>

Predicting popularity of blog articles has reached a **94 % AUC** level on a completely insulated validation set.

It has also provided **useful insights** about predictive impact from unstructured data, timing, classification and word count.

**Natural Language Processing** has been combined with **Machine Learning**. In Machine Learning, eXtreme Gradient Boosting has proved somewhat more performing than Random Forest. Working on bootstrapped resample distributions has defeated overfitting, revealed true distributions and opened up the way to the ensemble solution that has reached a 94 % AUC level.
