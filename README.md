## II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

<br>

In this project, a **94 % AUC** level has been reached in predicting news popularity on the validation set.

It has also provided **useful insights** about predictive impact from unstructured data, timing, classification and word count.

**Natural Language Processing** has been combined with **Machine Learning**. In Machine Learning, *Random Forest* has proved somewhat more performing than *eXtreme Gradient Boosting*. Working on bootstrapped resample distributions has defeated overfitting, revealed true distributions and opened up the way to an ensemble solution that has slightly outperformed both individual models.
