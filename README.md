## NLP-Blog-Popularity-Prediction

<br>

### I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In this project, a **94 % AUC** level has been reached in predicting news popularity on the validation set.

It has also provided **useful insights** about predictive impact from unstructured data, timing, classification and word count.

**Natural Language Processing** has been combined with **Machine Learning**. In Machine Learning, *Random Forest* has proved somewhat more performing than *eXtreme Gradient Boosting*. Working on bootstrapped resample distributions has defeated overfitting, revealed true distributions and opened up the way to an ensemble solution that has slightly outperformed both individual models.

### III. Files

This project is lodged with the GitHub repository https://github.com/Dev-P-L/NLP-News-Popularity-Prediction and is comprised of four files:

- README.md,
- NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.Rmd (all code),
- NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.html (methodology, insights, results)
- and NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.pdf (idem in other format).

I recommend reading methodology, insights and results in the HTML version rather than the PDF version. The HTML version offers a dynamic table of contents, graphs and tables are not split over two pages and more color brings, in my perception, more readability.  The file NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.html is comprised of the HTML source code. To access the rendered HTML pages, you only have to prepend https://htmlpreview.github.io/ to the original URL
