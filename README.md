## NLP-Blog-Popularity-Prediction

<br>

### I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In this project, a **94 % AUC** level has been reached in predicting blog articles popularity on the validation set.

It has also provided **useful insights** about predictive impact from unstructured data, timing, classification and word count.

**Natural Language Processing** has been combined with **Machine Learning**. In Machine Learning, *eXtreme Gradient Boosting* has proved somewhat more performing than *Random Forest*. Working on bootstrapped resample distributions has defeated overfitting, revealed true distributions and opened up the way to an ensemble solution that has slightly outperformed both individual models.

### III. FILES

This project is lodged with the GitHub repository https://github.com/Dev-P-L/NLP-News-Popularity-Prediction and is comprised of four files:

- README.md,
- NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.Rmd (all code),
- NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.html (methodology, insights, results)
- and NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.pdf (idem in other format).

I recommend reading methodology, insights and results in the HTML version rather than the PDF version. The HTML version offers a dynamic table of contents, external links and URLs are clickable, graphs and tables are not split over two pages and more color brings, in my perception, more readability.  

Wishing to visualize Report.pdf? Very easy: just download it from GitHub.

Wishing to visualize Report.html?

  * You could open it in GitHub Desktop.

  * Alternatively, you could use the URL https://rawcdn.githack.com/Dev-P-L/Bank-Marketing/17b63a112231f23fa7729ed62b9a5998b0a1adad/Report.html which, when activated, delivers Report.html to the browser with the correct Content-Type headers. The URL has been obtained by introducing the GitHub URL of Report.html into https://raw.githack.com/ as suggested in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6551446/can-i-run-html-files-directly-from-github-instead-of-just-viewing-their-source .

    Alternatively again, you could knit Report.Rmd or ask me by email for a copy of Report.html.
