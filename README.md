## NLP-Blog-Popularity-Prediction

<br>

### I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In this project, a **94 % AUC** level has been reached in predicting news popularity on the validation set.

It has also provided **useful insights** about predictive impact from unstructured data, timing, classification and word count.

**Natural Language Processing** has been combined with **Machine Learning**. In Machine Learning, *Random Forest* has proved somewhat more performing than *eXtreme Gradient Boosting*. Working on bootstrapped resample distributions has defeated overfitting, revealed true distributions and opened up the way to an ensemble solution that has slightly outperformed both individual models.

### III. FILES

This project is lodged with the GitHub repository https://github.com/Dev-P-L/NLP-News-Popularity-Prediction and is comprised of four files:

- README.md,
- NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.Rmd (all code),
- NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.html (methodology, insights, results)
- and NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.pdf (idem in other format).

I recommend reading methodology, insights and results in the HTML version rather than the PDF version. The HTML version offers a dynamic table of contents, external links and URLs are clickable, graphs and tables are not split over two pages and more color brings, in my perception, more readability.  

But the file NLP_News-Popularity-Prediction.html is comprised of the HTML source code. To access the rendered HTML pages, you only have to prepend e.g. https://htmlpreview.github.io/ to the original URL of the HTML file https://github.com/Dev-P-L/NLP--NYTimes-News-Popularity-Prediction/blob/master/NLP_News_Popularity_Prediction.html and click on the combination. In other words, just click on https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Dev-P-L/NLP--NYTimes-News-Popularity-Prediction/blob/master/NLP_News_Popularity_Prediction.html . 

About prepending, see e.g. discussion at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8446218/how-to-see-an-html-page-on-github-as-a-normal-rendered-html-page-to-see-preview .
